					<h3 class="subheading">Learning disabilities</h3>
					<p>Based on the specifications provided by the British Dyslexia Association and the World Wide Web Consortium, Valmiki automatically corrects the typography, contrast ratios, and other visual elements on a webpage to make reading easier for users with learning disabilities.</p>

					<h3 class="subheading">Visual impairment</h3>
					<p>On the press of a button (or a key), Valmiki extracts all relevant content on a webpage and reads it out in a language of the userâ€™s choice. Valmiki can also translate that text into another language, and visually impaired users only have to press a few keyboard shortcuts for all of this.</p>

					<h3 class="subheading">Senior citizens</h3>
					<p>Senior citizens who are not used to browsing the web can switch to Valmiki's Reading Mode which removes all unnecessary links, ads, and popups, and presents the relevant content in a beautiful readable format. They can also easily change the font size and contrasts based on their eye defects.</p>

					<h3 class="subheading">Everyone else</h3>
					<p>Valmiki is incredibly customizable, and users can easily change all properties and styles like text color, font family, and image contrasts for a consistent experience across the web. It remembers your settings, and they are automatically applied on any website you visit.</p>
