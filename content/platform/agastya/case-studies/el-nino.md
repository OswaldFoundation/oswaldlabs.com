{{< quote text="Agastya is really the best way to have accessibility options embedded into a webpage. Its dyslexia-friendly mode and night mode help our users read text, and it has several other features which are just plug-and-play and require minimal configuration." author="Michael Angelo Groeneveld, Founder, El Niño" >}}
