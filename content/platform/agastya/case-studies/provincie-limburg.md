## How does Provincie Limburg use Agastya?

In November-December 2018, Oswald Labs worked with Provincie Limburg on building Aristotle, an AI-powered e-learning platform for the schools of Limburg. The app was the winner of the Education category at Brighthack in Heerlen and won a €12,500 grant from Provincie Limburg for implementation in schools.

The online learning platform uses Agastya's accessibility features to make it more usable for students with dyslexia, visual impairment, and more disabilities, along with a chatbot to answer students’ frequently asked questions which could be trained by all teachers.
