## How does CLS Group use Agastya?

CLS Group is a specialist US financial institution that provides settlement services to its members in the foreign exchange market.

In November 2018, Oswald Labs worked with CLS Group on building CLShare, an app to help CLS Group with employee engagement. The app was the winner of the CLS Engagement App Challenge in London and won a Â£10,500 grant from CLS Group for implementation.

Using Agastya's features, CLS employees with disabilities such as dyslexia can more easily use the app and get access to company updates, announcements, and submit anonymous feedback.
