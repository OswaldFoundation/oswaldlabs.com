Wikipedia is the world's largest curated source of knowledge. You can find information about any and everything on Wikipedia, but this information is not always accessible to everyone. Using Wikibility, users with learning disorders like dyslexia, senior, blind users, etc., can all easily use Wikipedia.

It automatically highlights difficult words and works across all of Wikipedia's languages. Wikibility is a proof-of-concept app which implements Agastya on Wikipedia.
