Over 5% of the world's population – or 466 million people – has disabling hearing. These users usually prefer to talk using sign language, but only a small number of people actually know sign language. Furthermore, there are several kinds of sign languages around the world, so speakers in India speak a different sign language from those in the US. This makes it very hard for users with deafness understand what people are saying.

Live Subtitles is an app which uses real-time speech recognition to show the captions of what someone is saying while they are talking. With the app, users with deafness can just read what people are saying to understand them better.
