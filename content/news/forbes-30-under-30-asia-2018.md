“Judges on this year’s list included business magnates like Allan Zeman and Hiroshi Mikitani for Retail & E-commerce category; iconic fashion designer Vivienne Tam and singer Kris Wu for The Arts and Entertainment & Sports categories, respectively. We’ve also enlisted the help of some of the most successful tech entrepreneurs in the region including Sonny Vu of Fossil and S.D. Shibulal of Infosys as well as prominent tech investors like Kai-fu Lee of Sinovation and Anna Fang of ZhenFund to choose the finalists in the Finance & Venture Capital category.”

“Oswald Labs’ mission is to create technology that is universally accessible. The company, cofounded by Anand Chowdhary and Nishant Gadihoke, offers a free online reading tool for people with dyslexia and other visual complications that works via a widget that can be “plugged in” by developers to most websites.” (Forbes)
