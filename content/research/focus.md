                <h2 class="subheading-3">Technologies</h2>
                <p>In our first attempt, we are focusing on the following technologies and methods, with an extensive focus on user testing, peer feedback, and external collaborations.</p>

                <h2 class="subheading-2">Legibility</h2>
                <p>How can we make text more readable for users? All our products focus on increasing legibility through typography, and we measure their results in this research.</p>

                <h2 class="subheading-2">Web technologies</h2>
                <p>How can we make the web more accessible? It is not very hard for developers to use ARIA or semantic markup, but it needs to be encouraged and taught.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 mb-5">

                <h2 class="subheading-2">Hardware</h2>
                <p>What would enabling devices of the future look like? We incubate and work with hardware teams to build blind and dyslexia-friendly reading devices.</p>

                <h2 class="subheading-2">Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                <p>How can AI be used for accessibility? We use computer vision to automatically generate ALT tags for images around the web and use machine learning for smart actions.</p>

                <h2 class="subheading-2">Human-centered design</h2>
                <p>How do we let user customize the design of websites and apps based on their preferences? Our plugins and apps remember and recommend design changes.</p>

                <h2 class="subheading-2">Screen readers</h2>
                <p>Instead of reading aloud just everything, our algorithms automatically detect the dominant and important content on a webpage and read that instead.</p>
