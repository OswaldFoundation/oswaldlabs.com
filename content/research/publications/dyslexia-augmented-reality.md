## Abstract

Dyslexia is a specific learning disability which affects a personâ€™s ability to read, spell and understand language while reading or writing. There is a need to improve accessibility for problems faced by the dyslexic. Our system employs Augmented Reality using a smartphone camera in order to overcome these obstacles by enabling user-adjustment of background-text contrast ratio and text customization in real life. After testing the application, we received positive results with a 21.03% decrease in their overall reading time for the text passages. Therefore our application proves to be a great aid in the lives of people suffering from dyslexia.
