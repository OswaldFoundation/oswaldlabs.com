---

Two months ago, 18-year-old Anand Chowdhary and 15-year-old Nishant Gadihoke decided to take this problem head on. The Delhi-based teenagers created an app called Oswald, that helps people with dsylexia, visual impairment, and learning disorders to browse the web easily. Gadihoke and Chowdhary teamed up while studying at the Mother's International School. "We would work on projects as part of our school's computer club MNET, and have been designing and developing websites and apps for numerous organisations including Google, and the government," said Chowdhary in an interview with HuffPost India."
