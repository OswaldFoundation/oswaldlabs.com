We collect and use your information internally and may disclose your information to others, third parties outside of Oswald Labs, in certain situations that are described in the Privacy Policy.

The Privacy Policy addresses two kinds of information: (1) Personal Information; and (2) Anonymous Information.

Personal Information identifies you as an individual, such as your first and last name, address, school, email address, online contact information, image or audio of your voice. Anonymous Information does not identify you and can be combined with Anonymous Information about other users.

Data derived from cookies: what pages you viewed, how long you were on a particular page or whether you clicked on a link, feature or option. A cookie is a small file we place on your computer and acts as a unique identifier. A cookie does not allow us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. By declining to accept cookies you may not have access to Oswald Labs features.

When a user uses Oswald Labs software on your website, we collect information about them to store their preferences. We also collect information about your website’s pageviews, users, actions like click and interaction, etc., to track plugin usage.
